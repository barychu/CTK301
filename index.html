back in 2013, a Mario 64 speedrunner named DOTA_Teabag was running a 70 star race when suddenly Mario up warped in a situation where it normally would be impossible.
when attempting to recreate the glitch, people found that it was impossible to do so, even when recreating his exact inputs with a TAS bot.
after lots of experimenting, it was found that it could only be recreated by flipping a single bit from a 0 to a 1 inside the console itself, a normally impossible thing to do.
after years of speculation, the general consensus on what happened is that an ionic particle from space somehow collided with a microelectronic inside his console.
this caused the bit change from 0 to 1.
normally, a single bit change would only have negative consequences, if any at all, but the bit it changed just so happened to be related to Mario's vertical positioning.
the single bit change was just enough to change a value in a long sequence from a 4 to a 5, which was exactly enough for Mario to warp to the platform above him.
theoretically, if this glitch could be recreated, it would revolutionize Mario 64 speedrunning.
instead, it's a now impossible glitch that will only ever be seen once.
the chances of this glitch happening and being caught on film is less likely than you being struck by lightning, winning the lottery, becoming president, and then being struck by lightning again.
